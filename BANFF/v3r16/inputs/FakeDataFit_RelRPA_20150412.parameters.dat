and their covariance.

Whether to apply an additional scaling factor to the MC POT.  Would typically
only use this if wanted to scale MC to a desired POT to check fit performance.
Default to false.

The desired POT to scale the MC to.
< BANFF.ScaledMCPOT = 5.90E20 >

Whether to use the lower memory version of spline storage.  Only available for
performing a fit.  There may be unexpected behaviour including but not limited
to crashing if this is set to true for toy throwing.

Whether to use a previous fit result as the prior for the parameters.
< BANFF.ThrowToys.UseFitResult = 0 >

Which file to take the fit result from.
< BANFF.ThrowToys.FitResultFile = fit_output_run4w.root >

Which fit to take from the file.  If the file only contains one fit, set to 0.

Parameters that affect the fit code
=======================================================

Whether to perform the fit to data.
< BANFF.RunFit.FitData = 0 >

from.
