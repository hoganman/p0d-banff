T2KReWeight 

A package for T2K systematics evaluation using event reweighting. 

The package is designed to allow many different weighting libs to be 
included within a unified framework. See src/T2KWghtEngineI.h for how
this is done. 

For a simple example of how to reweight events look in the 
$T2KREWEIGHT/app directory.

shell% export T2KREWEIGHT=/path/to/top/level/t2kreweight/dir
shell% export PATH=$T2KREWEIGHT/bin:$PATH
shell% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$T2KREWEIGHT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
       (or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for MAC OS X)

shell% cd $T2KREWEIGHT
shell% ./configure <options>

See configure --help for more options


* Building:

shell% cd $T2KREWEIGHT
shell% make


Notes:

* Configuring with GENIE, NEUT, JNuBeam

The concrete implementations of the T2KWghtEngineI ABC event reweighting
class are thin interfaces to the corresponding generator event 
reweighting code/libraries. 
To enable them to work you need to 
a) Install and setup the relevant generator.
b) Use --enable-genie, --enable-neut, --enable-jnubeam at the 
T2KReWeight configuration step (see configure --help for additional 
requirements).

See $T2KREWEIGHT/example_scripts for some example setup and configure scripts.

See http://www.genie-mc.org for more details on how to install GENIE 
and the GENIE reweighting libraries. The verbosity of the GENIE output can be
cut down by setting the GPRODMODE environment variable to YES. See GENIE 
documentation for more control of output level.
See [TOBEFILLED] for more details on how to install the NEUT 
reweighting libraries.
See [TOBEFILLED] for more details on how to install the JNUBEAM 
reweighting libraries.

* Psyche and reading oaAnalysis files

The user should install and configure nd280Highland (currently the
head is needed). This will provide the library need to to read
oaAnalysis files. All related headers and libraries and their
locations will be taken from the associated CMT envrionment variables.
