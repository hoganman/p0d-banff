/// Respin 5D: this is a finished sand-MC production, using software version v10r11p11.  Users should use respin 5D for their sand interaction MC samples.
/// Respin 5E: this is a finished full MC production, using software version v10r11p17.
/// Respin 5F: this is an finished full MC and full data production, using software version v10r11p21 (and v10r11p23).
///            The data reprocessing includes improvements to the calibration constants.  Users should use this respin for their data and MC samples.
/// Respin 5G: this is a finished spill data production, using software version v10r11p27.  This processing was done at request of pi0 calibration task force.
///            It includes improvements to p0dRecon aimed at fixing data/MC discrepancies seen in pi0 analysis.
/// Respin 5H: this is a respin for Read Data Run 5 (First Pass) only, using software version v10r11p23 and updated Beam Summary Data Files (of Jul 5, 2014).
///
/// http://www.t2k.org/nd280/datacomp/production006/production006
///
/// Respin 6A: this is a stopped,failed production, using software version v11r29.  The production was stopped because of several serious bugs (989: 990: 992:995).
/// Respin 6B: this is an ongoing production, using software version v11r31. For Real Data run 5, only run 55 was processed as First Pass with early Beam Summary Data Files.
///            Analysers should use this respin for MCP.
/// Respin 6C: this is a v11r31 respin for Real Data runs 5 and 6. The First Pass Processing (fpp) used pre-existing calibration tables and early BSD.
///            Partially Calibration 1 (pc1) contains updated calibration tables, updated BSD but no inter-detector timing.
///            Real Data Processing (rdp) contains the full set of calibrations, corrections, BSD and inter-detector timing. For run6 the rdp has incomplete constants and BSD.
/// Respin 6D: this is a MC only production using nd280 v11r31 on top of neut 5.3.2.2 (additional proton FSI)
/// Respin 6E: RDP only using v11r31p5 which features new P0D ECal timing calibrations. Run 7 FPP goes as this respin.
/// Respin 6F: this an RDP and MCP respin using v11r31 with nd280Analysis v1r47p1 prepended to the CMTPATH.
///            It features additional FGD vertex information frozen into oaAnalysis v5r29p25. The RDP files are missing the BSD.
/// Respin 6G: this is an RDP-only respin using nd280 v11r31p7. It features additional FGD vertex information frozen into oaAnalysis v5r29p25.
/// Respin 6H: this is an MCP-only respin using nd280 v11r31p9 (same as v11r31p7 but with incorrect software tags). It features the trexRecon replacement of tpcRecon and is
///            intended both for trexRecon validation and tpcGas analysis.
/// Respin 6I: this is an RDP-only respin using nd280 v11r37 (same as v11r31p9 but with correct software tags). It features the trexRecon replacement of tpcRecon and is
///            intended both for trexRecon validation and tpcGas analysis.
/// Respin 6J: this is a Neut MCP-only respin using nd280 v11r31p11. It features the new NeutG4CascadeInterface_QGSP_BERT physics list for nd280mc.
/// Respin 6K: this is an RDP-only respin using nd280 v11r31p5.  This has correct ECAL timing corrections (and other ECAL corrections) for runs 5 and 6.
///            For runs 1-4 the output is the same as respin 6E and has just been copied over from 6E. Analysers should use this respin for RDP. 
/// Respin 6L: this is an MCP-only production using nd280v11r31p27 to produce run7 and run8 magnet MCP with the 2015-08 baseline (featuring 5/6 fgd2 water panels).
